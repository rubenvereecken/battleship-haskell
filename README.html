<h1>Battleship Haskell</h1>

<p>This project was created for the course Programming Paradigms at the University of Antwerp by Ruben Vereecken in 2014.</p>

<h2>Running the game</h2>

<p>To run the game one simply has to run <code>Battleship.main</code>. This can be done easiest by running <code>runhaskell Battleship.hs</code>.</p>

<p>The game interactively prompts for input. First names will be asked, then ship coordinates and afterwards the game can be
played by interactively entering coordinates to target. Feedback will be provided about the effectiveness of the shot.</p>

<p>Here is an example game where An utterly destroys Bert while Bert tries to hit An in the same spot over and over again.
It is of course a happy day scenario with no faulty input.</p>

<p><code>
An
Bert
(0,0);(0,1)
(6,7);(7,7);(8,7)
(3,3);(3,4);(3,5);(3,6)
(5,9);(6,9);(7,9);(8,9);(9,9)
(6,6);(6,7)
(3,2);(3,3);(3,4)
(9,6);(9,7);(9,8);(9,9)
(4,9);(5,9);(6,9);(7,9);(8,9)
(6,6)
(6,7)

</code></p>

<p>It can also be run using the following command.</p>

<p><code>
cat example.txt | runhaskell Battleship.hs
</code></p>

<p>Example output.</p>

<h2>About the implementation</h2>

<p>Some basic error mechanisms are in place. Faulty input is detected and most IO errors are handled. In case anything goes
wrong the user is prompted to re-enter whatever they just tried to enter. Validity of a ship's
location is checked as well: both whether it overlaps with others or whether it lies in a continuous straight line.</p>

<p>When the game's finished, both resulting playing boards will be showed with an ASCII representation.</p>

<p>The program is written as Haskell-y as a strongly IO-oriented program allows. Since it's still a highly interactive game,
this wasn't as clean as I'd have wanted, since Haskell is rather poor at handling sequential things. However, I tried
keeping the impure and pure parts as separate as possible. On the surface there are some monolithic input gatherers
that call pure and clean Haskell functions below. These can be detected by their <code>IO a</code> return types.</p>
